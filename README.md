# Student Result Analyzer

The Student Result Analyzer is a simple Python-based mini project designed to
analyze student academic performance. The program takes marks for multiple
subjects and calculates the total, average, grade, and pass/fail status.

## Features
- Accepts marks for multiple subjects
- Calculates total and average marks
- Assigns grade based on average score
- Displays pass or fail result clearly

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Conditional statements
- Functions and loops

## How It Works
1. The user enters the student name.
2. Marks for each subject are provided as input.
3. The program calculates total and average marks.
4. Based on the average, a grade and result are assigned.

## Purpose
This project was developed to practice basic Python programming concepts and
real-world logic implementation, making it suitable for beginners.

## Output
The program displays the student's name, total marks, average score, grade,
and final result.
