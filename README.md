# Fake News Detection

This project is a simple machine learning-based application that classifies
news text as fake or real using basic NLP techniques.

## Features
- Classifies news as Fake or Real
- Uses TF-IDF for text vectorization
- Applies Logistic Regression model

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## How It Works
1. News text is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF.
2. A Logistic Regression model is trained on labeled data.
3. The model predicts whether a given news text is fake or real.

## Purpose
This project was developed to understand basic NLP concepts
and machine learning classification techniques.
